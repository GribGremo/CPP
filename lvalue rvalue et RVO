/*Here you don't see any construction or destruction even if i create temp,
the reason why is due to compilator optimisation, temp is returned so the
compilator didn't really "created" it, it is directly build into return space
memory (see RVO=Return Value Optimisation, disable it with -fno-elide-constructors flag)*/

    /*Here a difference, even if my operators return a rvalue,
    if res already exists my RVO will not shut the the constructors 
    destructors, in case an object already exist (affectation)
    he has to modify an object, in case he is building it the 
    compilator know that it is the same operation than in my operator 
    function when i create temp, a construction and not an assignation,
    so the RVO is authorized to shut the construction/destruction message,
    no assignement operator will come in the middle, it grants the possibility
    to the programmer to make an assignement operator custom*/
    
    /*Here msg is not a reference because "a++" return a rvalue,
you can't put a reference to a rvalue, because a rvalue is
temporary and does not have an address, accordingly it will
make a copy of a Fixed object, this is why they appear when
i call print color with a Fixed argument*/
