Assignement name: vect2
Expected files: vect2.cpp vect2.hpp

Create a class vect2 representing a mathematical vectorof dimmension 2 containing elements of type int.

It must support addition, substraction, and multiplication by such as the expression (Vect2(2,2)*2==Vect2(4,4) is true).

The operator [] can be used to access the components of your vector (using indices 0 and 1), no bound checking is required.

Your object must be printable with << operator, such that 
    std::cout << v << std::endl;
produces the same output as:
    std::cout << "{" << v[0] << ", " << v[1] << "}" << std::endl;
